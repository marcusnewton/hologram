# Hologram
Ubiquitous augmented reality for collective sense-making. Built using Holochain.

A 'hologram', in this sense, is a 1:1 mapping of a virtual reality onto the Globe. The idea is that agents can create and place virtual objects onto this augmented layer, and others running the same version of Hologram can observe and interact with these virtual objects using any AR-compatible device.

In a sense, each fork of Hologram (a 'hologram') is a unique virtual world. Some may allow anybody to share virtual objects, others might be restricted to a single person (e.g. an artist who has made a virtual artwork, a science teacher showing students some 3D models of molecules, or a game developer providing a virtual environment for a mobile game). A hologram could just involve two agents doing a long-distance conversation, where their faces can be displayed in corresponding locations (think- Star Wars!). Some holograms could aid navigation with virtual signage.

We can be aspirational about what these holograms could do for collective sense-making. Examples: 

- What could a ubiquitous virtual world do for mathematics? Instead of a piece of paper as your canvas, we would have a dynamic 3D world to explore and manipulate mathematical objects and equations.

- What could it do for transcontextual explorations of complex systems? We could express the complexity of human systems through a process of co-creation of a virtual world, mapping not only the causal loops but also the contextual detail in the relationships between parts, between subsystems.
